# Arcade-Game-Engine

This is a small personal Small Game Engine project. 
I have currently made Breakout and Tetris, with Asteroids and Pac-man in development.
The game engine currently has Input handling, file loading, BMP Sprite sheet asset support, Collision Physics, 
Graphics and Text rendering and UI elements to name a few.

Some Improvements that could be made are to move the rendering to a graphics API such as OpenGL, DirectX or Vulcan.

In order to run this, you will also need SDL installed. the makefile given should allow you to run the rest.
